# <PreWork-Study_Guide>

## Description

I created this project as my first walkthrough for my Coding Bootcamp, completing this allowed me to learn about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git!

It solves the problem of not having a study guide availible to me for the course.
My motivation for the project was to learn and explore the world of programming, also I enjoyed going through the modules and completing each step!
